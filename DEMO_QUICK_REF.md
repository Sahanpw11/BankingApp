# 🔒 Security Demo Quick Reference

## ⏱️ 3-Minute Security Demo Flow

### 1. Login Security (45 seconds)
- [ ] Navigate to `/login`
- [ ] Show secure authentication
- [ ] Demonstrate password validation
- [ ] Explain JWT token security

**Key Points:**
- "Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2 + salt"
- "JWT tokens include device fingerprinting"
- "All authentication is encrypted end-to-end"

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (45 seconds)
- [ ] Go to Settings > Security
- [ ] Enable 2FA with QR code
- [ ] Show TOTP verification
- [ ] Explain enhanced security

**Key Points:**
- "TOTP-based 2FA for maximum security"
- "QR code generation for easy setup"
- "Time-based codes prevent replay attacks"

### 3. Transaction Security (90 seconds)
- [ ] Create a money transfer
- [ ] Show encrypted balance display
- [ ] View transaction in history
- [ ] Show digital signature verification

**Key Points:**
- "Every transaction is digitally signed"
- "Account balances encrypted in database"
- "Real-time signature verification"
- "Complete audit trail maintained"

### 4. Code Architecture (30 seconds)
- [ ] Show `digital_signature.py`
- [ ] Show `encryption.py`
- [ ] Explain security middleware

**Key Points:**
- "RSA-2048 digital signatures"
- "AES-256 data encryption"
- "Modular security architecture"

### Authentication
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Device fingerprinting

### Transaction Security
- ✅ Digital signatures on all transactions
- ✅ Real-time signature verification
- ✅ Transaction integrity checks
- ✅ Non-repudiation guarantees

### Access Control
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ Account ownership verification
- ✅ Rate limiting protection
- ✅ Secure API endpoints

## 📱 Demo Script Lines

**Opening:**
"This banking application showcases enterprise-level security with multiple layers of protection."

**During Login:**
"Notice the secure authentication with encrypted credentials and JWT token generation."

**During 2FA:**
"Two-factor authentication adds an extra security layer with time-based codes."

**During Transactions:**
"Every transaction is cryptographically signed and account data is encrypted."

**During Code Review:**
"The security architecture uses industry-standard encryption and digital signatures."

**Closing:**
"This demonstrates production-ready security suitable for financial applications."

## ⚡ Troubleshooting
- If login fails: Check backend is running on port 5000
- If 2FA doesn't work: Ensure time sync on demo device
- If transactions fail: Verify database connection
- If signatures don't show: Check transaction_signer.py logs

## 🎬 Backup Demo Points
If short on time, focus on:
1. Login security (JWT + encryption)
2. Transaction digital signatures
3. Account balance encryption
4. Security architecture overview
