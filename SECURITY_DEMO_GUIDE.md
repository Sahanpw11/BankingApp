# Banking Application Security Demo Guide

## Overview

This secure banking application demonstrates enterprise-level security features including encryption, digital signatures, authentication, and transaction security. Perfect for showcasing modern security practices in financial applications.

## 🔒 Core Security Features

### 1. **Multi-Layer Authentication**

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: 
  - Stateless token system that doesn't require server-side sessions
  - Tokens contain encrypted user identity and permissions
  - Automatic token refresh mechanism prevents session hijacking
  - Includes device fingerprinting for additional validation
  - Tokens expire automatically for security (configurable timeout)

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: 
  - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) implementation using industry-standard algorithms
  - QR code generation for easy setup with authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
  - Backup codes provided for account recovery scenarios
  - Optional SMS-based 2FA as alternative method
  - Prevents unauthorized access even if password is compromised

- **Password Security**: 
  - PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with 100,000 iterations
  - Unique salt generated for each password to prevent rainbow table attacks
  - Minimum password complexity requirements enforced
  - Password history tracking prevents reuse of recent passwords
  - Secure password reset with time-limited tokens

- **Session Management**: 
  - Secure session tokens with configurable expiration times
  - Automatic session termination after inactivity
  - Session invalidation on password change or suspicious activity
  - Multiple device session tracking and management
  - Concurrent session limits to prevent account sharing

### 2. **Data Encryption**

  - Separate encryption keys for different data types (accounts, transactions, personal info)
  - Key rotation mechanism for enhanced security over time
  - Encrypted database backups with separate key management
  - Performance-optimized encryption that doesn't impact user experience

- **Asymmetric Encryption**:
